### General Info
***
A Cafe website I built for one I found on Instagram, just a passion project. Played with the Google Places API, and brushed up fundamentals with UI/UX, and CSS responsiveness.
[Alt link to website with different hosting provider, fonts work, google api still nil](http://maujo.surge.sh)

Side information: I can't seem to make the google api work in production env. Must be the hosting provider Netlify, but not sure. Please message me if you know why.

## Bugs
***
1. **Server won't fetch google api in production**
So it works fine in development. When I host it, I have to change the fetch url to domain name. It kinda goes off. Around Lines 97 in main.js. HELPPPP! 
2. __Video tags won't autoplay on load sometimes__ 
On some browsers* The video tags default to the poster. If you know fixes, I'm ears.
3. **Fonts won't get past CORS on Netlify**
So, again, works in development, AND production, works with a different hosting provider 'surge'. visit ***maujo.surge.sh*** to see the supposed fonts. But doesn't work with netlify.
